# 📊 NumPy & Pandas Employee Analysis

A beginner-level data analysis project using **NumPy** and **Pandas** to practice data cleaning and exploratory analysis on an employee dataset.

## 🗂️ Dataset
The dataset contains employee information such as age, salary, experience, department, city and performance rating.  
It includes missing values, extreme values and a highly right-skewed salary distribution, making it useful for practicing real-world data handling.

## 🧠 Project Overview
The notebook focuses on:
- Data cleaning (missing values, outliers, skewed data)
- Exploratory data analysis using Pandas
- Correlation analysis and grouped insights

## 🔍 Analysis Performed
- Salary vs Experience correlation
- Department-wise salary comparison
- Performance rating vs salary
- City-wise salary variation within departments
- Average performance rating by department
- Age vs performance relationship
